# TokenLogin
A really simple plugin which logs in to your Discord account via token through a command.

Special Thanks to [Blog explaining how to login using a token in https://discord.com/app](https://www.followchain.org/login-in-discord-token/)

Inspired by [JustKamiii](https://github.com/FifiTheBulldog/token) which is inspired by zt64 Aliucord plugin, where JustKamiii used WolfPlugs osu plugin as a base.

Usage:
```{prefix}token [TOKEN]```
